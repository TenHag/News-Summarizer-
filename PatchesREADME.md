# Summ-zer
Here are some changes that can be made to improve the project:

~Pulling Articles:
		1] Since we're getting only the top 5 articles, we can add the option wherein the user can ask for even more articles and the next 5 will be displayed.
		
~Summarizing Articles:
		1] When the articles are picked, they are all summarized at the same time as well which takes a bit longer for the results to be displayed. This can be improved by summarizing a particular article only when the user clicks it's title.
		2] Summerizing articles only from the trusted news reporters such as Espn,cricinfo etc.
		
~GUI:
		1] Formatting can be better
		2] Can create a better interactive GUI
		
		
Feel free to suggest some more changes.
